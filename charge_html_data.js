	if the methods are not properly defined, they may not return any value or interact with the properties as intended.
        In the given example, shape is an object with properties name and age, and methods out1 and out2. Currently, these methods only access the 
	properties without returning any value, which makes them incomplete.
	To refactor this code, we should modify the methods out1 and out2 to return the values of name and age, respectively. This will allow us to 
        retrieve and use these values when calling the methods.`;
